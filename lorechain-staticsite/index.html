            <p>I’m a philosophy major, a solo creative, and a passionate advocate for decentralized systems. Through LoreChain, I want to explore how blockchain can empower creators, while learning and sharing my progress every step of the way.</p>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>Building in public means transparency—sharing what I'm learning, the challenges, and the breakthroughs. Through blog posts, social media updates, and GitHub repos, you’ll be able to follow the entire journey.</p>
            <p>I'm committed to creating something meaningful and sustainable, and LoreChain will not just be another platform, but a community where creators thrive. Stay tuned for updates as we get closer to launch!</p>
